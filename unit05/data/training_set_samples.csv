1,Would not recommend: I bought this printer two years ago and it seemed noisy and erratic from the beginning. The cartridges seemed to run out very fast and were quite expensive. Now I will be buying a new printer as it has a hardware problem that is not worth fixing.I would recommend spending the extra money for a better printer. You will avoid chasing good money after bad later on.,385
1,"Former Dune Fan: OK - I am done with Dune. The original series, written by F. Herbert, was excellent - it was so well detailed and written that I could almost smell the spice. The Butlerian Jihad, however, has convinced me to move on. This work was poorly written, poorly thought out, and wordy instead of detailed; it was a silly book.The Titans, the evermind, the other thinking machines were all comic caricatures of what they could have been. The inane dialog was so mind-numbing, I had to struggle through each page.My advice: read ANYTHING else- anything. Save your money, save your time, save your sanity.",612
1,"The trailer fooled me for once.: This film was marketed like Stiller's return to good films. I saw many big posters while leaving theaters that had me waiting for this one. I couldn't watch it at the theater because it came and went so I rented it on blu ray. The most disappointing thing about the film is the central character, if only he was a little likable, this film could have been much more tolerable. The director should have had a more promising cast, the pace of the film was all over. This film didn't even have a saving grace other than the fact that it ends. This is not even worth watching on home box office.",624
1,Did not like: I did not like this spray and gave it to a co-worker. I used it twice and had to stop. It left a gross film on my hair and did not make my hair smooth and silky.,175
1,"yuck: if one could synthesize all that is bad about the current music scene, the forlorn whining, the annoying vocals, the cookie cutter sounds, this is the band and the album you would have. and we do. YUCK",207
1,"bland: Larry, as always, displays fine technical skill, fluency, and articulation, as well as the occasional tasty choice of notes however, there is just too much of that, ""wonder how long I'll be on hold on the phone?"" or ""when's my floor coming in the elevator"" sound about it. Certainly disappointing when you consider some of this artists fine achievements with the likes of Steely Dan etc.",394
1,"Devastatingly disappointing: The first two books take you on an amazing, wonderful rollercoaster ride, only to have the third book hurl you into a whole other direction that is diappointing and confusing. I was so upset to fall in love with Lyra and Will to end up with a bunch of anti-God speeches and a sad ending. The anti-christian message in this book becomes apparent by the end of book two and just gets hammered in throughout book 3. At websites devoted to His Dark Materials there are quotes about Pullman using these books to counteract the Chronicles of Narnia and God. As a parent, I would be disturbed to have my young children (target audience) read how Man/Woman is the saviour of us all. There is no way a parent would know that this is what the books are really about. They are so beautifully written; the third book just broke my heart. If children read this, parents should read it with them. Lots to discuss.",928
