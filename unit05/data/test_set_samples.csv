1,"Dull and depressing: The first few chapters of this book were encouraging, but somewhere in the middle the story just fell apart. I was expecting Ilana's life to unfold into a tale of adventure consistent with her youthful ambition, but as soon as she moves to the city, she loses all her spark and likeability and becomes a closed-minded old hag.Her daughters and their daughters are not much better. Their characters are boring, one-dimensional, and unlikeable. There is nothing interesting about their life stories or the depressing tenement in which they live.I forced myself to finish the book, hoping that one or more of them would get a life sooner or later and the energy of the earlier chapters would reappear. It never did.",733
1,AVERAGE B MOVIE: I have just watched this -about 9 years after the rest of the world.I wish I had not wasted 2 hours.It is so poor that it could only frighten a child.It 's plot is so overdone that you get never get involved in it.Its got all the excesses of a gory comic strip.Anyone who never worked out after 2 seconds that Hannibal was in the ambulance is easily duped. Its a piece of trash for people who like trash but dont expect to be impressed.,453
1,"Made for kids who know long words....: I watched this with my little sister, and neither of us were impressed. It didn't tell us much of anything, acting like it was really cool. It seemed like it was made for kids (ones, my sister points out, who know some long words), and the quality almost indicated it was made BY kids. The commentator is a young girl who's not much of an actress, and sounds too excited for things not that exciting.Eyewitness videos are much more entertaining and informative.",500
1,Not what expected!: Have read books much better than this video. Not enough variety and could have been much more informative with various settings.,148
2,"Thank you: This product works best for my system. I'm glad I purchased it. Thank you for this product, it helps in my over all health. I hope every one learns to take better care of themselves without being made to feel as though they shouldn't or that they are being to vain or selfish. Nonsense. God wants all of us to enjoy being healthy.",341
2,"Loved it!: One of my all time favorites! I love this book, found it very well written and it is truly a remarkable story. Highly recommend it!",142
2,"A little different: Great entertainment from a special guy. The dances are not done in the standard American Ballroom style, but I got some ideas from them. Considering the low price I am glad I bought it. If you want to learn to dance from the beginning, get something else.",275
1,"Troma would've done a better job: I am being generous with this 1 star. That's merely for the special effects and good opening scene.However, after that it all boils down to almost 2 hours of boredom. The action is bland and all has been done before. The acting and script, if you can call it that, is so plain and painfull. The talent that is there is completely wasted on this follow up.Troma studios would've done a better job than this.Not worth buying, only viewable if you are completely and utterly bored and there is nothing left on the shelves of your local video store.",579
1,"Nothing but problems: I can't print more than 10 pages before the printer has a ""fuser unit failure"" and has to sit for fifteen minutes before it will reset. This has happened 3 times so far and I am still waiting for the printer to reset as we speak. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this piece of junk.",317
2,"Satisfied: It's simple to use since it has no pump. I made copies of the sheet showing dates, time and results. My only negative is that instead of being able to keep it straight, the tube curves which might affect the outcome. But then the base would be out of reach!",268
