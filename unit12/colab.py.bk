# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex - V2

[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.

This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions using Neo4J.

This notebook updates the GraphRAG pipeline to v2. If you haven’t checked v1 yet, you can find it [here](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/docs/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v1.ipynb). Following are the updates to the existing implementation:

1. Integrate with Neo4J Graph database.
2. Embedding based retrieval.

## Installation

`graspologic` is used to use hierarchical_leiden for building communities.

"""## GraphRAGExtractor

The GraphRAGExtractor class is designed to extract triples (subject-relation-object) from text and enrich them by adding descriptions for entities and relationships to their properties using an LLM.

This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

**Key Components:**

1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.
2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.
3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.
4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.
5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.


**Main Methods:**

1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.
2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.
3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.


**Extraction Process:**

For each input node (chunk of text):
1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.
2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.
3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata
4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.
5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.

**NOTE:** In the current implementation, we are using only relationship descriptions. In the next implementation, we will utilize entity descriptions during the retrieval stage.

The GraphRAGQueryEngine class is a custom query engine designed to process queries using the GraphRAG approach. It leverages the community summaries generated by the GraphRAGStore to answer user queries. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

**Main Components:**

`graph_store:` An instance of GraphRAGStore, which contains the community summaries.
`llm:` A Language Model (LLM) used for generating and aggregating answers.


**Key Methods:**

`custom_query(query_str: str)`

1. This is the main entry point for processing a query. It retrieves community summaries, generates answers from each summary, and then aggregates these answers into a final response.

`generate_answer_from_summary(community_summary, query):`

1. Generates an answer for the query based on a single community summary.
Uses the LLM to interpret the community summary in the context of the query.

`aggregate_answers(community_answers):`

1. Combines individual answers from different communities into a coherent final response.
2. Uses the LLM to synthesize multiple perspectives into a single, concise answer.


**Query Processing Flow:**

1. Retrieve community summaries from the graph store.
2. For each community summary, generate a specific answer to the query.
3. Aggregate all community-specific answers into a final, coherent response.


**Example usage:**

```
query_engine = GraphRAGQueryEngine(graph_store=graph_store, llm=llm)

response = query_engine.query("query")

-Goal-
Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Given the text, extract up to {max_knowledge_triplets} entity-relation triplets.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Type of the entity.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"$$$$<entity_name>$$$$<entity_type>$$$$<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

Format each relationship as ("relationship"$$$$<source_entity>$$$$<target_entity>$$$$<relation>$$$$<relationship_description>)

3. When finished, output.

"""## Docker Setup And Neo4J setup

To launch Neo4j locally, first ensure you have docker installed. Then, you can launch the database with the following docker command.

```
docker run \
    -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
    -v $PWD/data:/data -v $PWD/plugins:/plugins \
    --name neo4j-apoc \

    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true \
    -e NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS=\[\"apoc\"\] \
    neo4j:latest
```
From here, you can open the db at http://localhost:7474/. On this page, you will be asked to sign in. Use the default username/password of neo4j and neo4j.

Once you login for the first time, you will be asked to change the password.
