When they express opinions or respond to complicated requests, their speech is highly intelligible. Their use of basic and complex grammar is good and their use of vocabulary is accurate and precise.

Test takers at level 8 can also use spoken language to answer questions and give basic information.

Their pronunciation and intonation and stress are at all times highly intelligible.

### Level 7
**Scale Score: 160 - 180**

Typically, test takers at level 7 can create connected, sustained discourse appropriate to the typical workplace. They can express opinions or respond to complicated requests effectively.

In extended responses, some of the following weaknesses may sometimes occur, but they do not interfere with the message:
• minor difficulties with pronunciation, intonation or hesitation when creating language

Test takers at level 7 can also use spoken language to answer questions and give basic information.

When reading aloud, test takers at level 7 are highly intelligible.

### Level 6
**Scale Score: 130 - 150**

Typically, test takers at level 6 are able to create a relevant response when asked to express an opinion or respond to a complicated request. However, at least part of the time, the reasons for, or explanations of, the opinion are unclear to a listener. This may be because of the following:
• unclear pronunciation or inappropriate intonation or stress when the speaker must create language
• mistakes in grammar
• a limited range of vocabulary

Most of the time, test takers at level 6 can answer questions and give basic information. However, sometimes their responses are difficult to understand or interpret.

When reading aloud, test takers at level 6 are intelligible.

### Level 5
**Scale Score: 110 - 120**

Typically, test takers at level 5 have limited success at expressing an opinion or responding to a complicated request. Responses include problems such as:
• language that is inaccurate, vague or repetitive
• minimal or no audience awareness
• long pauses and frequent hesitations
• limited expression of ideas and connections between ideas
• limited vocabulary

Most of the time, test takers at level 5 can answer questions and give basic information. However, sometimes their responses are difficult to understand or interpret.

When reading aloud, test takers at level 5 are generally intelligible. However, when creating language, their pronunciation, intonation and stress may be inconsistent.

### Level 4
**Scale Score: 80 - 100**

Typically, test takers at level 4 are unsuccessful when attempting to explain an opinion or respond to a complicated request. The response may be limited to a single sentence or part of a sentence. Other problems may include:
• severely limited language use
• minimal or no audience awareness
• consistent pronunciation, stress and intonation difficulties
• long pauses and frequent hesitations
• severely limited vocabulary

Most of the time, test takers at level 4 cannot answer questions or give basic information.

When reading aloud, test takers at level 4 vary in intelligibility. However, when they are creating language, speakers at level 4 usually have problems with pronunciation and intonation and stress. For more information, check the "Read Aloud Pronunciation and Intonation and Stress Ratings."

### Level 3
**Scale Score: 60 - 70**

Typically, test takers at level 3 can, with some difficulty, state an opinion, but they cannot support the opinion. Any response to a complicated request is severely limited.

Most of the time, test takers at level 3 cannot answer questions and give basic information. Typically, test takers at level 3 have insufficient vocabulary or grammar to create simple descriptions.

When reading aloud, speakers at level 3 may be difficult to understand. For more information, check the "Read Aloud Pronunciation and Intonation and Stress ratings."

### Level 2
**Scale Score: 40 - 50**

Typically, test takers at level 2 cannot state an opinion or support it. They either do not respond to complicated requests or the response is not at all relevant.

In routine social and occupational interactions such as answering questions and giving basic information, test takers at level 2 are difficult to understand.

When reading aloud, speakers at level 2 may be difficult to understand. For more information, check the "Read Aloud Pronunciation and Intonation and Stress Ratings."

### Level 1
**Scale Score: 0 - 30**

Test takers at level 1 left a significant part of the TOEIC Speaking Test unanswered. Test takers at level 1 may not have the listening or reading skills in English necessary to understand the test directions or the content of the test questions.
